# Simple Console Calculator

A basic console-based calculator application written in C# (with no A.I.) for practice purposes.

Took around 4 hours to make without AI

## Features

- Performs basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- Simple menu-driven interface
- Basic input validation

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio (or your preferred C# IDE)
3. Build and run the program
4. Follow the on-screen instructions:
   - Enter two numbers
   - Select an operation
   - View the result
   - Choose to continue or exit

## Code Structure

- `Calculator.cs`: Contains the core calculator logic with basic arithmetic methods
- `Menu.cs`: Handles user interaction and input/output
- `Program.cs`: Main entry point of the application

## Notes

This was created as a practice exercise to reinforce C# fundamentals including:
- Class structure
- Basic arithmetic operations
- User input handling
- Simple flow control

The project focuses on core functionality rather than comprehensive error handling or advanced features.

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements could include:
- More robust error handling
- Support for decimal numbers
- Additional mathematical operations
- Better user experience
