## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Dependency Injection** (Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting)
- **Clean Separation**:
  - Services (business logic)
  - Interfaces (abstractions)
  - Helpers (utility classes)
- **SOLID Principles** applied

### Key Components
| Component          | Responsibility                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `TaskService`      | Core task operations                   |
| `Menu`             | User interaction flow                  |
| `TaskDisplayer`    | Presentation logic                     |
| `UserTask`         | Data model with enums                  |
| `IntInputValidator`| Input validation                       |

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Build and run in Visual Studio (or `dotnet run`)
3. Follow the menu prompts:
   - Enter your name
   - Choose from 7 main options
   - Manage your tasks

## Code Quality Highlights

- Strong typing with enums (`TaskPriority`, `TaskStatus`)
- Input validation throughout
- Single Responsibility Principle in classes
- Dependency injection for testability
- Clear separation of concerns
